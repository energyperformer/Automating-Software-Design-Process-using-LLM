Please generate UML code in PlantUML format with the following actors and use cases. Follow the exact syntax:

@startuml
Actors:
actor "• Allow"
actor "• Receive"
actor "Control System  
Correlator  
Hardware  
Correlator 
Backend  
Data Processing  EVLA Monitor  
& 
Control System"
actor "Serviceability"
actor "the Backend Data Processing System"

Use Cases:
usecase "processing"
usecase "processing hardware"
usecase "processor hardware failure"

Links:
"• Allow" --> "processing"
"• Allow" --> "processing hardware"
"• Allow" --> "processor hardware failure"
"• Receive" --> "processing"
"• Receive" --> "processing hardware"
"• Receive" --> "processor hardware failure"
"Control System  
Correlator  
Hardware  
Correlator 
Backend  
Data Processing  EVLA Monitor  
& 
Control System" --> "processing"
"Control System  
Correlator  
Hardware  
Correlator 
Backend  
Data Processing  EVLA Monitor  
& 
Control System" --> "processing hardware"
"Control System  
Correlator  
Hardware  
Correlator 
Backend  
Data Processing  EVLA Monitor  
&

"Serviceability" --> "processing"
"Serviceability" --> "processing hardware"
"Serviceability" --> "processor hardware failure"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processing"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processing hardware"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processor hardware failure"

Ensure that the UML code follows the above format exactly, without additional text or explanations.

Example:

"Actors:

actor "• Allow"

actor "• Receive"

actor "Control System"

actor "Software   

Data Processing  EVLA Monitor  

& 

Control System"

actor "System
