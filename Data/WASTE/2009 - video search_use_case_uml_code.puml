Please generate UML code in PlantUML format with the following actors and use cases. Follow the exact syntax.


Examples:

@startuml
actor "User"
actor "Admin"
usecase "Login"
usecase "Register"
"User" --> "Login"
"Admin" --> "Register"
@enduml

@startuml
actor "Customer"
actor "Sales Rep"
usecase "Place Order"
usecase "Cancel Order"
"Customer" --> "Place Order"
"Sales Rep" --> "Cancel Order"
@enduml
    
Actors:
actor "• Allow"
actor "• Receive"
actor "Control System Correlator Hardware Correlator Backend Data Processing EVLA Monitor & Control System"
actor "Serviceability"
actor "the Backend Data Processing System"

Use Cases:
usecase "processing"
usecase "processing hardware"
usecase "processor hardware failure"

Links:
"• Allow" --> "processing"
"• Allow" --> "processing hardware"
"• Allow" --> "processor hardware failure"
"• Receive" --> "processing"
"• Receive" --> "processing hardware"
"• Receive" --> "processor hardware failure"
"Control System Correlator Hardware Correlator Backend Data Processing EVLA Monitor & Control System" --> "processing"
"Control System Correlator Hardware Correlator Backend Data Processing EVLA Monitor & Control System" --> "processing hardware"
"Control System Correlator Hardware Correlator Backend Data Processing EVLA Monitor & Control System" --> "processor hardware failure"
"Serviceability" --> "processing"
"Serviceability" --> "processing hardware"
"Serviceability" --> "processor hardware failure"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processing"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processing hardware"
"the Backend Data Processing System" --> "processor hardware failure"
